## Getting Started

First, duplicate the `.env` file into a new file named `.env.local`. Update the dummy values with your keys.

The first time you are running this project, you will need to install the dependencies. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
yarn
```

To start the app, run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
